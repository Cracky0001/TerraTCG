TerraTCG is a Terraria-themed Collectible Card Game! Challenge your
Town NPCs to intense games of 1v1 card-based combat, grow your collection
with booster packs, and experiment with exciting new strategies! The initial 
set of TerraTCG contains 100 cards, with over 25 NPC decks to duel against!
To start your TerraTCG journey, craft a deck box with 5 wood at a Workbench,
then talk to the Guide for a tutorial!


Enjoy a game of TerraTCG with your NPCs!
----------------------------------------
To get an early start to your TerraTCG collection, you can find packs scattered
throughout chests in any newly generated world!

You can start growing your collection by playing against and beating any of the 
following NPCs:
- the Guide
- the Merchant
- the Nurse
- the Arms Dealer
- the Goblin Tinkerer
- the Party Girl
- the Traveling Merchant
- the Dryad
- the Clothier
- the Nerdy Slime

Beating an NPC's initial deck will unlock a more challenging deck for that opponent!

Grow your Collection!
---------------------
All 100 TerraTCG cards can be obtained by opening packs rewarded by beating NPCs or
bosses in a game! Each pack has a 1-in-15 chance to upgrade a card to a rare foil
variant!

Up the Stakes!
--------------
Once you've gotten enough practice playing against your Townsfolk, you're ready to
challenge the bosses themselves! Beating an NPC's second deck awards you with an
"Duel Invitation", an item that can be used in the presence of a boss to start
a life-or-death game of TerraTCG! The loser of a boss game's soul is forfeit!
