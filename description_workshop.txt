For a full illustrated gameplay tutorial, talk to the Guide in-game
and ask to duel!

[b]=== Initial Setup ===[/b]

TerraTCG is a card game played between two players. Each player begins by 
shuffling their deck and drawing 5 cards. One player is then selected
randomly to go first.

Each player has 3 resource types:
[list]
[*] Hearts: The player's life total. Each player starts with 3 hearts, 
losing one whenever a Creature they control dies. If a player loses all 
3 hearts, their opponent wins the game!

[*] Mana Crystals: Spent to perform most actions in the game, such as 
attacking with Creatures or equipping Items. Start at 1 per turn,
then regenerate at a growing rate throughout the game.

[*] Townsfolk Emblem: Used to cast Townsfolk, powerful one-off cards that
can turn the tide of the game. Only 1 is generated per turn.
[/list]

[b]=== Card Types ===[/b]

There are 3 types of Card in TerraTCG:
[list]
[*] Creatures, which are placed onto the battlefield for combat
[*] Items, which provide temporary or permanent buffs to creatures
[*] Townsfolk, which provide powerful single-use effects like card draw.
[/list]

Creature Cards are the core of gameplay. They can be placed onto the battlefield
from the hand for no cost. At any point in your turn, you may declare an attack 
with a creature in your Offense Row. Attacking with a creature consumes Mana 
Crystals equal to that creature's attack cost. Dealing damage to opponents'
creatures via attacks is key to victory, since you need to reduce 3 opposing
creatures' health to zero to win the game!


Item Cards can be attached to creatures, and provide bonuses to their stats. It 
costs Mana Crystals to play Items from the hand. Items provide effects such as
[list]
[*] Increasing a creature's attack damage
[*] Reducing a creature's attack cost
[*] Restoring a creature's health
[/list]

Carefully balancing your Mana Crystal usage between buffing creatures with items 
and dealing damage will allow you to gain advantage over your opponent over the
course of a game!


Townsfolk are a special card type that provide powerful sources of advantage,
such as:
[list]
[*] Drawing cards
[*] Gaining extra mana crystals
[*] Buffing your creatures without spending Mana Crystals
[/list]

You can only use one Townsfolk per turn, which consumes your single Townsfolk Emblem.
